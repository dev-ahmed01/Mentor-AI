# Hackathon implementation progress

Active source: [phases and Codex prompt](MentorAI_Hackathon_Phases_and_Codex_Prompt.md).
The original foundation/career phase numbers differ from the hackathon numbers.

## Phase 0 — baseline verification (15 September 2026)

- Preserved the existing uncommitted career implementation.
- Added career authentication, boundary, stable-list-identity, and reproducibility checks.
- Reproduced profile editing failure (HTTP 409) in the browser against PostgreSQL
  and in a failing integration test. Flush skill orphan removals before inserting
  replacement rows, within the same transaction; repeated saves and removal pass.
- Updated stale onboarding/dashboard copy and superseded AI-first plan pointers.
- Added Next.js's smooth-scroll attribute after reproducing its runtime warning.
- Java 21 and current Java 25: 11 tests passed, zero failures/errors.
- Frontend: locked install, lint, and production build passed using `npm.cmd`.
- PostgreSQL 17.11: V1 and V2 applied to an empty isolated database, followed by
  Hibernate schema validation. Windows launch uses `-Duser.timezone=UTC` because
  this PostgreSQL image rejects the legacy `Asia/Calcutta` name.
- Browser: registration, seven-step onboarding, dashboard, analysis, and career
  detail verified. No React list-key warning reproduced; all rendered IDs are
  present and distinct in the new API regression test.

The existing npm dependency audit reported 2 high and 1 critical findings.
Dependency hardening remains separate from feature verification.

- Current Java 25/PostgreSQL API smoke: registration, sign-in, repeated profile
  save (8 to 6 hours while retaining skills), career analysis and detail passed.
- Independent read-only review found no blockers in the baseline fixes.
- Browser extension disconnected after the earlier walkthrough. Post-fix browser
  recheck remains pending; the reproduced save bug passes both its automated
  regression and the real PostgreSQL API smoke check.

## Next gate

Checkpoint the baseline, then implement and verify Phase 1 skill dependencies.
